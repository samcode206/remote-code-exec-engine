# remote-code-exec-engine
a code execution engine that runs code in isolated containers against a set of test cases, Built with NodeJs, Docker & Redis, highly scalable and can handle CPU intensive jobs in parallel. 

To Add: 
1. add more layers of security around the container 
2. add support for more languages (java, c++, go, c#)
3. add more pre-defined test case (coding challenges, currently there is only fibonachi for testing purposes)
